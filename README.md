In this project, I analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories.
I find the answers to the following questions:
- What is the number of distinct countries present in the database?
- What country has the highest amount of debt?
- What country has the lowest amount of repayments?
